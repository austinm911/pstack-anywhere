# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

A message that asks for work, such as "use pstack to fix this bug", is not a help question. Read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and do the work under it. Read `../poteto-mode/capabilities.md` before making claims about this harness's workers, tools, or persistence.

This file maps questions to the skills and guide pages that hold the answers. Those files own the details. Read the file you route to before you quote it, and trust it when it disagrees with this map. Skill links point into the installed pack. For a public skill link, use `https://github.com/austinm911/pstack-anywhere/blob/main/skills/` followed by the skill's path. Upstream guide links below are pinned public pages, not files in this install.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- No pstack override block means every model role uses the parent model. Look in the context file the current harness actually loads, or the source its context manager renders.
- No `verify-*` skill or other app harness in the project means agents have no scripted way to drive the app. Mention `/create-verification-skill` when the question is about proving a change works.
- No formal verification skill in the project means no property is checked past what tests reach. Mention `/create-formal-verification-skill` when the question is about a race, an invariant, or another case tests rarely hit. When one exists and the code it covers changed after the commit it records as last in sync, mention `/maintain-formal-verification-skill` if the question touches that code.

When the model rule is missing and it matters, ask whether the user wants to pick a model for each role and a reasoning budget now. It matters when the user is new, the question is about setup or cost, or the answer depends on which models run. Ask at most once per chat. If the need is also unclear, ask both questions together. Offer two choices:

- Now: give them `/setup-pstack-anywhere` to type, and answer their question too.
- Later: answer their question, and add one line saying every role keeps its default model until they run `/setup-pstack-anywhere`.

## Get set up

1. Install the whole pstack-anywhere pack through the user's existing skill manager, or `npx skills add austinm911/pstack-anywhere` when no manager exists. Do not install a competing copy.
2. Run [`/setup-pstack-anywhere`](../setup-pstack-anywhere/SKILL.md). It confirms available tools, models, and reasoning budget, then writes the role block. The block applies to new sessions. Then it offers once each to generate a verification skill and a formal verification skill for the project, unless the project already has one.
3. Run the installed `setup-pstack-anywhere/scripts/doctor.mjs` and start a real task with `/poteto-mode`, a goal, and a check that can pass or fail.

Whether a skill loads automatically depends on its installed frontmatter and the current harness. The [port README](https://github.com/austinm911/pstack-anywhere#install) and [upstream setup guide](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/01-setup.md) have the details. Offer to word the first prompt with the user, per [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md).

If cost is the worry, say where the tokens go and how to spend fewer. pstack spends extra tokens on subagents and review panels. Rerun `/setup-pstack-anywhere` and pick a smaller budget or cheaper models. A role set to `auto` or `inherit-parent` runs on the chat's model, which saves tokens when the chat runs on Auto or a cheaper model. A shorter panel list runs fewer subagents, one for each entry. Save `/poteto-mode` for work that needs rigor.

This is the pstack-anywhere port. Read `../poteto-mode/capabilities.md` for the current harness's `spawn_worker`, `worker_durability`, `wake_on_event`, and `worker_defaults` mappings. Never imply a worker, recurring wake, or runtime driver is available because another harness provides it.

## Start a task with `/poteto-mode`

`/poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the todo list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. Read [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) before you help word one. [Guide page 2](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/02-poteto-mode.md) has examples.

Whether `/poteto-mode` stays on depends on the current harness. On Cursor, a normal skill invocation attaches it to one message, while Use as Mode keeps it in context. Other harnesses must use their supported persistence mechanism, or start each new task with `/poteto-mode`. Do not claim Cursor's mode controls exist elsewhere.

The conversation receiving `/poteto-mode` owns the playbook. A named `poteto-agent` is usable only when the current delegate tool offers it. Otherwise provide an ordinary worker the exact brief and this skill's absolute path, per `worker_defaults`.

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

| The user wants to | Skill |
|---|---|
| Do any non-trivial task with rigor | [`/poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) |
| Check that the agent understood their goal and the problem before it starts | [`/in-your-own-words`](../in-your-own-words/SKILL.md) |
| Get a prompt rewritten deeper, not bigger, before sending it: what a top professional would add, their raw material and methods, and an outside check. It returns the prompt and doesn't do the task | [`/sharpen`](../sharpen/SKILL.md) |
| Know how code works now, or where new code should live | [`/how`](../how/SKILL.md) |

| Have different models review a diff and try to break it | [`/interrogate`](../interrogate/SKILL.md) |
| Fix a bug test-first when a cheap local test exists | `/tdd` |
| Apply TypeScript rules to `.ts` or `.tsx` work | [`/typescript-best-practices`](../typescript-best-practices/SKILL.md) |
| Strip comments before review, using a reviewer that didn't write them | [`/no-comments`](../no-comments/SKILL.md) |
| Clean AI tells out of prose | [`/unslop`](../unslop/SKILL.md) |

| Hear the last reply again in plain words | [`/bro`](../bro/SKILL.md) |
| Give agents a scripted way to drive the app and prove behavior | [`/create-verification-skill`](../create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Bring a verification skill and its feature map back in line with the app | [`/maintain-verification-skill`](../maintain-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Formally verify a race, invariant, or other property that tests rarely reach | [`/create-formal-verification-skill`](../create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Bring a formal verification back in line after the code it covers changed, and learn whether a failure is drift or a bug | [`/maintain-formal-verification-skill`](../maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Show a PM or designer what the user sees as a chart checked by a model, with each bug drawn as a numbered path, turn an agreed chart into a TLA+ skeleton, or audit the code against its TLA+ spec | [`/statechart`](../statechart/SKILL.md) |
| Vet a performance number before reporting or acting on it | [`/benchmark-checklist`](../benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md) |
| Run a large or cross-cutting change, or one to review after stepping away | [`/figure-it-out`](../figure-it-out/SKILL.md) |
| Keep a decision log during a run, and review it afterward | [`/show-me-your-work`](../show-me-your-work/SKILL.md) |
| Pick a model for each role and a reasoning budget | [`/setup-pstack-anywhere`](../setup-pstack-anywhere/SKILL.md) |

| Find their way around pstack | `/poteto-help` |

The pack ships `tdd` and `teach`. Its install policy lets a manager preserve existing same-name definitions as optional install choices, so this help table does not make them required sibling dependencies. Inspect the definition actually installed before recommending either. If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/how` explains what the code does. `/why` explains the reasons. `/teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/interrogate` reviews the diff. `/blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. `/ketchup` covers only this chat since the user's last message. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

Not in pstack:

- Pre-commit cleanup, UI verification, and CLI verification use `slop_strip`, `ui_driver`, and `cli_driver` from the override block. With no driver, name the runtime verification gap.
- Recurring wakeups and skill authoring use `wake_on_event` and `skill_authoring`. Their absent paths are in `capabilities.md`.
- pstack has no `/orchestrate` skill. Orchestrate is a `/poteto-mode` playbook. If the slash menu shows `/orchestrate`, another plugin provides it.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs Autopilot-full. "stack them, don't ship" runs Autopilot-stack.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

Without `/poteto-mode`, the current harness may select another skill matching a phrase such as "babysit this pr" instead. The Playbooks section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists every playbook and when it applies. [Guide page 6](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/06-verify-and-ship.md) covers opening, babysitting, and landing a PR.

pstack's planning route is a playbook. Use the current harness's planning mechanism when it offers one. For work that spans phases or stacked PRs, asking `/poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and doesn't implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output." Typing `/principle-<name>` still loads one on demand. [Guide page 8](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/08-principles.md) lists them.

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The mode stopped applying after a few turns | Check the current harness's persistence mechanism, or start each task with `/poteto-mode`. |
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | The rule from `/setup-pstack-anywhere` applies to new chats. Start one. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill didn't load on its own | Check the installed frontmatter and current harness's discovery rules. Hidden skills need a direct invocation or path. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Give each agent its own worktree, or run them through the harness's worker capabilities, which each get their own machine. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | The `wake_on_event` capability needs a check that can pass or fail, not just a duration. See [guide page 7](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/07-overnight.md). |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

For a run that drifts, [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) has one-line steers. [Guide page 10](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/10-recipes-and-pitfalls.md) has more pitfalls and the recipes worth copying.

## Make pstack my own

- [`/automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/poteto-mode`.
- [`/reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

[Guide page 9](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/dbf49813a39c1a5389c5e28cb8e4c1c2379e2454/pstack/docs/guide/09-make-it-yours.md) covers each of these.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, adapted from [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) when one fits, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
